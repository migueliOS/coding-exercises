# SwiftUI example app: Koober
We're porting the example app from our Advanced iOS App Architecture book from UIKit to SwiftUI and we are sharing the code in this repo.

Please feel free to follow along and/or contribute. This is an experimental codebase we're using to learn how to best architect SwiftUI apps.
